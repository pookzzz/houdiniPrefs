"""Creates a variant set from USD assets in a directory."""


This node creates a variant set from USD assets in a directory, it supports wildcards. This is useful for generating variants of assets that can be randomized on the stage such as  books, tables or HDR environments. The variant names will be the filenames.

@parameters

    == Reference ==

    Primitive Path:
        #id: primpath
        USD primitive path in the stage that the variant set will  be added.
        
    File Pattern:
        #id: filepath
        Defines the file pattern for the referenced USD files  (e.g., $HIP/USD/HDR/*.usd). If the file path contains  spaces, enclose the path in quotes.
        
    Reference Type:
        #id: reftype
        The type of composition arc to create to the referenced  prim.
        
    Reference Operation:
        #id: refop

        How new references added by this node interact with  existing references on the prim at Primitive path. When editing references on a primitive, you are really  making edits to a list. These edits are expressed as  adding to the beginning or the end of the list created by  composing all weaker layers, or by explicitly removing  certain items from the list. 

        `Add as Strongest References in Prepend List:`
        Make new references stronger than any references from  lower layers, and stronger than any previous “prepend”  edits in the currently active layer. 

        `Add as Weakest References in Prepend List:`
        Make new references stronger than any references from  lower layers, but weaker than any previous “prepend”  edits in the currently active layer. 

        `Add as Strongest References in Append List:`
        Make new references weaker than any references from  lower layers, but stronger than any previous “append”  edits in the currently active layer.

        `Add as Weakest References in Append List:`
        Make new references weaker than any references from  lower layers, and weaker than any previous edits in the  currently active layer.

        `Remove References:`
        The layers or primitives referenced by this node are  removed from the list of references on the destination  primitive rather that being added. 
        Because this removal is expressed as a list edit, you  can selectively remove specific layers from the list of  references, no matter what layer authored the original  reference.

        
    Parent Primitive Type:
        #id: parentprimtype
        Specifies the type assigned to any intermediate prims  created if the prim at the specified Primitive Path does  not exist.
        
    == Variant ==

    Variant Set Name:
        #id: variantsetname
        Specifies the name of the variant set on the primitive.
