= Labs ML CV Synthetics Karma Rop =

"""Renders RGB image or ID EXR file for segmentation masking."""


This node is a modified version of the [Karma Render Settings|Node:lop/karmarenderproperties] node combined with the [USD Render Rop|Node:lop/usdrender_rop] and the [Background Plate|Node:lop/backgroundplate] node. Parameter defaults are set up to work with the [Labs ML CV ROP Synthetic Data TOP|Node:top/labs--ml_cv_rop_synthetic_data-1.0].

@parameters

    == Render Settings ==

    Enable ID:
        #id: enable_id
        Activates the ROPs configuration for the ID pass, which is  separated from the beauty pass ROP to maximize the use of Karma  XPU.
        
    Enable Texture Mask:
        #id: enable_tm
        Enables the use of texture mask GT Ground Truth.
        
    Enable Background Plate:
        #id: enable_bg_plate
        Activates the background plate setup as configured in the  Background Plate panel.
        Useful for hybrid data or exporting the  data on a transparent background with a shadow.
            
    Rendersettings Primitive Path:
        #id: primpath2
        This node creates a RenderSettings prim with the configuration you set up using the parameters.
        This is the scene tree path where this node will create the RenderSettings prim.
        
    Output Picture:
        #id: picture_rgb
        Specifies the path for the render output.
        Defaults to `@render_output`, an attribute created by the ROP Synthetic Data  TOP.

        
    Output Picture:
        #id: picture_id
        Specifies the path for the render output. Defaults to @render_output, an attribute created by the ROP Synthetic Data TOP.
        
    Camera:
        #id: camera
        Path to a USD camera (UsdGeomCamera) prim to render the scene from.
        
    Resolution Mode:
        #id: res_mode
        Use the USD Camera's aperture aspect ratio to automatically set one dimension of the resolution.
        
    Resolution:
        #id: resolution
        Specifies the image resolution for the render output.
        Defaults to  @res, an attribute created by the ROP Synthetic Data TOP.
