""" Create a tube from a curve, with UVs and normals. """

The cylinder generator wraps up some common functionality for generating tubes for realtime vfx. You can quickly set the inner and outer radius, modify the profile and add noise to shape the tube for multiple use cases. UV's are automatically laid out and adjusted with override controls. Add vertex colour based on u or v to drive material parameters in your game engine.

@parameters
    Direction:
        #id: direction
        The direction of the cylinder.

    End Caps:
        #id: endcaps
        Creates triangular caps for the open ends of the cylinder.

    Use Uniform Radius:
        #id: uniformradius
        When enabled a uniform radius is being used for the cylinder.
    
    Radius:
        #id: radius
        Defines the radius of the cylinder.

    Base Radius:
        #id: baseradius
        Defines the radius of the base circle for the cylinder.

    Top Radius:
        #id: topradius
        Defines the radius of the top circle for the cylinder.

    Height:
        #id: height
        Determines the size of the cylinder in the axis that is oriented.

    Sides:
        #id: sides
        Determines the number of sides the cylinder will have.

    Divinios:
        #id: divisions
        Determines the number of polygon divisions the cylinder has along its height.

    Arc Start:
        #id: arcstart
        Determines the starting point of the arc in degrees. That applies to the axis the cylinder is oriented.

    Arc End:
        #id: arcend
        Determines the ending point of the arc in degrees. That applies to the axis the cylinder is oriented.

    Enable Ramp:
        #id: enableramp
        Uses a multiplier and a ramp to change the height profile of the cylinder.

    Ramp Multiplier:
        #id: rampmultiplier
        Multiplies the effect of the curve ramp that is being used.

    Curve Ramp:
        #id: curveramp
        Applies the ramp to modify the height profile of the cylinder.

    Add UVs:
        #id: adduvs
        Generates and connects a Labs UV Unwrap Cylinder SOP to unwrap UVs.
