"""Performs compression and caching, or loading and decompression, of a VDB sequence to or from a single `.zibravdb` file."""


As a part of the [ZibraVDB for Houdini |https://www.zibra.ai] plugin, this node combines the functionalities of the [Labs ZibraVDB Compress SOP|Node:sop/labs--rop_zibravdb_compress-1.0] and the [Labs ZibraVDB Decompress SOP|Node:sop/labs--zibravdb_decompress-1.0]. It can compress/decompress both animated VDB sequences and static VDB geometries.

Similar to the [File Cache SOP|Node:sop/filecache], this node operates in two modes: 
* Caching mode: Compresses a VDB sequence and caches it to disk as a single  `.zibravdb` file.
* Loading mode: Loads a single `.zibravdb` file from disk and decompresses it as a VDB sequence.

The compression often achieves up to 97–99% reduction in VDB file size with minimal quality loss. The compression rate is adjustable for each VDB field, providing independent control over the quality and memory footprint of `density`, `temperature`, `flame`, and other standard or custom fields. Up to 8 float fields can be compressed simultaneously.

When reading back from disk, the entire sequence is loaded at once, with frames decompressed on demand using a frame index parameter. This significantly speeds up playback for high-resolution VDBs by eliminating the need to load one frame from disk at a time. Additionally, the total size of the data to be loaded is much smaller. The decompression occurs on the GPU and is extremely fast.

TIP:
    You may also compress SDF VDBs indirectly. Convert SDF VDBs to Fog VDBs before compression and back to SDF VDBs after decompression using the [Convert VDB SOP|Node:/sop/convertvdb].

TIP:
    You can force the compression and decompression to run on CPU instead of GPU via an environment variable: 
    `ZIBRAVDB_FOR_HOUDINI_FORCE_SOFTWARE_DEVICE = 1`

    On Windows, you can force the choice of graphics API via an environment variable:
    * `ZIBRAVDB_FOR_HOUDINI_FORCE_GRAPHICS_API = D3D12`
    * `ZIBRAVDB_FOR_HOUDINI_FORCE_GRAPHICS_API = VULKAN`

@parameters

    Load from Disk:
        #id: loadfromdisk
        If on, loads and decompresses the `.zibravdb` file specified in __File__ instead of cooking the input geometry.

    :include /nodes/sop/labs--zibravdb_decompress-1.0#refresh:
    
    File:
        #id: file
        The file path which the compressed VDB geometry will be saved to or loaded from. The file extension must be `.zibravdb`. During caching, any missing directories in the path will be automatically created.

    Delete Attributes:
        #id: deleteattributes
        The list of attributes to delete before compression and caching. Separate multiple attributes with spaces. This list applies to all attribute classes.
    
    Delete Groups:
        #id: deletegroups
        The list of groups to delete before compression and caching. Separate multiple groups with spaces. This list applies to all group types.
    
    Number of Casts:
        #id: numcasts
        The number of attribute casts to perform before compression and caching. Each combination of attribute class and precision requires a separate multiparm entry.
    
    Class:
        #id: class#
        The class of attributes to cast to the specified precision.
    
    Attributes:

        The list of attributes to cast to the specified precision. Separate multiple attributes with spaces.
    
    Precision:

        The target precision for the attributes.
