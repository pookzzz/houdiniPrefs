""" Create a polygon disc with UVs"""

The disc generator wraps up some common functionality for generating discs for realtime vfx. You can quickly set the inner and outer radius, and modify the profile to shape the disc for multiple use cases. UVs are automatically laid out and adjusted with override controls.

@parameters
    Orientation:
        #id: orientation
        Orientation of the shape.

    Inner Radius:
        #id: innerradius
        Defines the radius of the inner circle for the disc.

    Outer Radius:
        #id: outerradius
        Defines the radius of the outer circle for the disc.

    Sides:
        #id: sides
        Determines the number of sides the disc will have.

    Divisions:
        #id: divisions
        Determines the number of polygon divisions from the inner edge to the outer edge of the disc.

    Arc Start:
        #id: arcstart
        Determines the starting point of the arc in degrees. That applies to the axis that is perpendicular to the plane the disc is oriented.

    Arc End:
        #id: arcend
        Determines the ending point of the arc in degrees. That applies to the axis that is perpendicular to the plane the disc is oriented.

    Inner Height:
        #id: innerheight
        Determines the height of the inner circle. That applies to the axis that is perpendicular to the plane the disc is oriented.
        
    Outer Height:
        #id: outerheight
        Determines the height of the outer circle. That applies to the axis that is perpendicular to the plane the disc is oriented.

    Enable Height Ramp:
        #id: enableramp
        Uses a multiplier and a ramp to change the height profile of the disc.

    Ramp Multiplier:
        #id: rampmultiplier
        Multiplies the effect of the curve ramp that is being used.

    Curve Ramp:
        #id: curveramp
        Applies the ramp to modify the height profile of the disc.

    Add UVs:
        #id: adduvs
        Generates UVs for the fill of the disc.
