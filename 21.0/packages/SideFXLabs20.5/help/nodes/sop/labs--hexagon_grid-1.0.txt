"""Generates a hexagonal grid."""

This node generates a hexagonal point grid that can be filled with hexagonal primitives. You can also change the radius of the hexagon and its orientation, which can be either Pointy Top or Flat Top.

@parameters
    Primitive Type:
        #id: type
        Type of Geometry to create. In the case of Points, no geometry is created. Instead, free floating points are created in the same positions as they would be in a surface.

    Connectivity:
        #id: connectivity
        Whether to treat adjacent edges as a group, or as individuals.

    Orientation:
        #id: orientation
        The orientation of the grid.

    Shape:
        #id: gridshape
        The shape of the grid that is being created. The options include Hexagon, Triangle, Rectangle, and Parallelogram.

    Size:
        #id: gridsize
        Determines the size of the point grid.
    
    Horizontal Min:
        #id: q1min
        The minimum coordinate of the horizontal axis of the rectangle.
    
    Horizontal Max:
        #id: q1max
        The maximum coordinate of the horizontal axis of the rectangle.
    
    Vertical Min:
        #id: r2min
        The minimum coordinate of the vertical axis of the rectangle.
        
    Vertical Max:
        #id: r2max
        The maximum coordinate of the vertical axis of the rectangle.

    Axes:
        #id: axes
        A pair of axes from the cube coordinate system of the hexagonal grid.

    Axis 1 Min:
        #id: axis1min
        The minimum coordinate of the first axis of the shape.
    
    Axis 1 Max:
        #id: axis1max
        The maximum coordinate of the first axis of the shape.
    
    Axis 2 Min:
        #id: axis2min
        The minimum coordinate of the second axis of the shape.
        
    Axis 2 Max:
        #id: axis2max
        The maximum coordinate of the second axis of the shape.

    Orientation:
        #id: tileorientation
        The orientation of the hexagon primitive. It can be set to Pointy Top or Flat Top. In Pointy Top the hexagons are aligned with their vertices pointing up and down, and the columns are offset, while in Flat Top the hexagons are aligned with their edges flat on the top and bottom, and the rows are offset.

    Radius:
        #id: tileradius
        Sets the radius of the hexagon primitive.

    Show Guide Geometry:
        #id: showguidegeometry
        Shows hexagon primitives overlayed on the point grid. Only available when Primitive Type is set to Points.

    Show Coordinate Gizmo:
        #id: showgizmo
        Shows a color-coded gizmo with three arrows indicating the direction of the QRS axes.

    Visualize Coordinate Axes:
        #id: coloraxes
        Colours the three axes of the QRS coordinate system, as well as the origin.

    Output Coordinates:
        #id: outputcoordinates
        Outputs the QRS cube coordinates as a point attribute. When Add Tile is enabled, the attribute is promoted to primitive.

    Coordinates Attribute:
        #id: coordinatesattribute
        The name of the coordinates attribute.
