    The original ML Computer Vision tools were developed by the Synthetic Data team at Endava PLC.


@parameters

    Source Point:
        #id: srcept
        The index of a single point to use as the source point. This can also be a point group but the group must only contain one point. This is ignored when the second input of this node is connected.

    Visualize Vector:
        #id: visvector
        Visualizes the vector as a line within the scene geometry.
