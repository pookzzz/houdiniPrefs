"""Visualizes vectors as arrows."""

This node visualizes vector attributes with arrows. There are options for coloring the arrows, changing their length and arrow body type, and visualizing their origin.

@parameters        
    == Visualizers ==

    Number of Visualizers:
        #id: viznum
        The number of attributes to visualize.

    Enable Visualizer:
        #id: enable
        Enables the visualizer.

    Label:
        #id: labelheader
        The name of the visualizer which derives from the attribute that is being visualized.

    Attribute:
        #id: vectorattribute
        The vector attribute that is being visualized.

    Normalize Vectors:
        #id: normalize
        Normalizes the vectors to a unit.

    Length Multiplier:
        #id: multiplier
        Multiplies the length of the vector.

    Coloring:
        #id: coloring
        The way the visualized vectors are being colored.

    Fixed Color:
        #id: fixedcolor
        The fixed and uniform color of the vectors that are being visualized.

    Color Mapping:
        #id: colorramp
        The ramp that colorizes the vectors that are being visualized, based on the minimum and maximum values of the attribute.

    == Settings ==

    Show Input Geometry:
        #id: keeporiginal
        Shows the input geometry alongside the visualizers.
    
    Body:
        #id: arrowbody
        The style of the arrow body. Options include Line, Tube, and Cone.
    
    Scale:
        #id: arrowscale
        Sets the size of the vector arrows.
    
    Show Origin:
        #id: showorigin
        Show the origin sphere.

    Radius:
        #id: originradius
        Sets the radius of the origin sphere.

    Color:
        #id: origincolor
        Sets the color of the origin sphere.
