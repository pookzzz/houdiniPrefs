""" Create base modules to use with the building generator, as well as override base module behavior. """

The gamedev building generator requires collections of named geometry. These collections are named 'wall', 'corner', 'top_ledge', and are referred to as modules. This node assists in the creation of these modules.

As well as setting module names and dimensions, this sop can also do localized overrides.

The handplaced override tab allows a module to ignore the building generator rules, and have its own transform defined.

The volumetric override tab will use the second input as a spatial override; if a part of a building intersects with this geometry, the specified module will be used instead.

@parameters
    == Building Module ==
    Module Name:
        Module to apply within the bounding box(es) connected to the second input.
    Module Dimensions:
        Target width and height of module in Houdini units. This is manually defined as the automatic bounds may not correspond to intent; eg flagpoles that extend away from the module surface.
    == Floor Description ==
    Floor Name:
        Name to assign this floor configuration.
    Expanded Form:
        Pattern arrangement of modules that will fill one side of the floor. Module names in `<>` brackets will repeat along the object, and module names in `[]` brackets will occur a single time unless succeeded by a number, then it will repeat that many times.
        <p>__Rigid__:  `[A], [A-B], [A][B], [A-B-A].`</p>
        <p>__Rigid (repeated)__:  `[A]3, [A-B]2.`</p>
        <p>__Fill (repeated)__:  `<A>, <A-B>, <A-B-A>.`</p>
        <p>__Variations__:  `<A*>, [B*], <A-B*>, [A*-B].`</p>
        <p>__Incorrect__:  `<*>, [*], <A*>, [A-B*], <A>2, <A><B>, missing Fill modules.`</p>
        A and B represent Building Modules
    Corners:
        Populates the right and left corner modules, respectively. If only the first parameter is populated with a corner module, both corners will apply this module.
    Variations:
        The number of floor variations to use for this floor.
    Variation:
        The name of the Floor to use as a variation. This name comes from the *Floor Name* parameter of a different _Labs Building Generator Utility SOP_.
    Weight:
        The weighted probability that this floor variation will be chosen in a random selection of floors.

    == Handplaced Overrides ==
    Action:
        Display or hide the bounding box reference.
    Use Embedded Boundingbox:
        Enable the bounding box utility to visually set the dimensions of this handplaced module.
    === Bounds Properties ===
    Center:
        Center of module.
    Size:
        Size of module.
    Uniform Scale:
        Uniform scale of module, the 3-value scale is multiplied by this value.
    Rotate:
        Rotation of this module.
    == Building Module ==
    Module Name:
        Module to apply within the bounding box(es) connected to the second input.
