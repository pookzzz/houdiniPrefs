= Labs ML CV Visualize Keypoints =

"""Visualizes keypoints and their connections."""


This node provides a set of tools for visualizing keypoints and their connections, enabling a clear representation of types, skeletal structures, and mirrored points.

    The original ML Computer Vision tools were developed by the Synthetic Data team at Endava PLC.


@parameters

    View Keypoints:
        #id: viskp
        Visualizes keypoints by displaying a sphere sprite on each point. The sphere sprite inherits its color from the point attribute `kp_color`.

    View Keypoint Type:
        #id: vistype
        Assigns colors to keypoints based on their `kp_type` attribute, ensuring that keypoints of the same type share the same color.

    Keypoint Scale:
        #id: jointscale
        In meters, the radius of the sphere sprite, with an additional multiplier from the `pscale` attribute.
        
    View Skeleton Connectivity:
        #id: visskel
        Visualizes the skeletal connections between keypoints with lines to visualize how they are connected.
        
    Wire Width:
        #id: wirewidth
        In meters, the thickness in meters of the skelleton connection lines.
        
    View Keypoint Swapable:
        #id: visswap
        Visualizes connection lines between points that are swappable mirrors of each other, such as the left elbow and right elbow.
        
    Wire Width:
        #id: radius
        In meters, the thickness in meters of the swappable lines.
