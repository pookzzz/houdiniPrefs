"""Compresses a VDB sequence and caches it to disk as a single  `.zibravdb` file."""


As a part of the [ZibraVDB for Houdini |https://www.zibra.ai] plugin, this node caches a VDB sequence to disk as a single, highly compressed `.zibravdb` file. It can compress both animated VDB sequences and static VDB geometries.

The compression often achieves up to 97–99% reduction in VDB file size with minimal quality loss. The compression rate is adjustable for each VDB field, providing independent control over the quality and memory footprint of `density`, `temperature`, `flame`, and other standard or custom fields. Up to 8 float fields can be compressed simultaneously.

TIP:
    You may also compress SDF VDBs indirectly. Convert SDF VDBs to Fog VDBs before compression and back to SDF VDBs after decompression using the [Convert VDB SOP|Node:/sop/convertvdb].

TIP:
    You can force the compression and decompression to run on CPU instead of GPU via an environment variable: 
    `ZIBRAVDB_FOR_HOUDINI_FORCE_SOFTWARE_DEVICE = 1`

    On Windows, you can force the choice of graphics API via an environment variable:
    * `ZIBRAVDB_FOR_HOUDINI_FORCE_GRAPHICS_API = D3D12`
    * `ZIBRAVDB_FOR_HOUDINI_FORCE_GRAPHICS_API = VULKAN`
