= Labs ML CV Texture Mask =

"""Adds geometry attributes needed for the mask ground truth pipeline."""


This node is a key part of the texture mask ground truth pipeline that allows you to use image masks as UV textures to create the ground truth on the surface of objects.

This node adds 3 attributes to the geometry before it is imported to LOPs for mask texturing:

# `texture_mask_id`: The unique instance ID of texture mask (which helps separate it from other objects of the same category).
# `texture_category_id`: The ID for the category that the mask ground truth will be categorized as.
# `texture_category_name`: The category name that the mask ground truth will be categorized as.

    The original ML Computer Vision tools were developed by the Synthetic Data team at Endava PLC.


@parameters

    == Texture Mask ==

    Texture Instance ID:
        #id: texinstid
        The integer that is used to distinguish objects within the same category as separate entities. This value is the pixel value rendered in the ID pass from the [Labs ML CV Synthetics Karma ROP|Node:lop/labs--ml_cv_synthetics_karma_rop-1.0] and used to generate COCO bounding boxes and segmentation.
        
    Category ID:
        #id: categoryid
        The integer that represents the category in the [COCO JSON|https://cocodataset.org/#home] file.
        
    Category_Name:
        #id: categoryname
        The string name of the category that will be associated with the integer category ID.
