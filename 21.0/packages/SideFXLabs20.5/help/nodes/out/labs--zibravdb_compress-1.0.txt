"""Compresses a VDB sequence and caches it to disk as a single  `.zibravdb` file."""


As a part of the [ZibraVDB for Houdini |https://www.zibra.ai] plugin, this node caches a VDB sequence to disk as a single, highly compressed `.zibravdb` file. It can compress both animated VDB sequences and static VDB geometries.

The compression often achieves up to 97–99% reduction in VDB file size with minimal quality loss. The compression rate is adjustable for each VDB field, providing independent control over the quality and memory footprint of `density`, `temperature`, `flame`, and other standard or custom fields. Up to 8 float fields can be compressed simultaneously.

TIP:
    You may also compress SDF VDBs indirectly. Convert SDF VDBs to Fog VDBs before compression and back to SDF VDBs after decompression using the [Convert VDB SOP|Node:/sop/convertvdb].

TIP:
    You can force the compression and decompression to run on CPU instead of GPU via an environment variable: 
    `ZIBRAVDB_FOR_HOUDINI_FORCE_SOFTWARE_DEVICE = 1`

    On Windows, you can force the choice of graphics API via an environment variable:
    * `ZIBRAVDB_FOR_HOUDINI_FORCE_GRAPHICS_API = D3D12`
    * `ZIBRAVDB_FOR_HOUDINI_FORCE_GRAPHICS_API = VULKAN`


== Getting Ready == (gettingready)


=== Download ZibraVDB Core Library ===

The plugin requires the ZibraVDB core library on the back end. (This library and its source code are proprietary to Zibra AI and, therefore, are not included directly in the open-source SideFX Labs package.) The plugin has a built-in method to download this core library, which only needs to be done once (per working environment).
# Click the __Open Plugin Management__ button on any ZibraVDB node. A pop-up window will appear.
# Click the __Download Library__ button. You will be redirected to a ZibraVDB for Houdini webpage.
# Download the ZibraVDB Compression Library from the webpage.
# Unpack the contents of the archive into the Houdini user preference directory:
    * On Windows, the default location is `%userprofile%/documents/houdiniX.Y`.
    * On Linux, the default location is `$HOME/houdiniX.Y`.
# Return to Houdini and click the __Load Library__ button in the __Plugin Management__ window. You should now see the __Library status__ as "Loaded", along with the library version.

:disclosure:Install to HSITE
    To copy the ZibraVDB Compression Library to HSITE for site-wide installation, click the __Copy Library to HSITE__ button in the __Plugin Management__ window and follow on-screen prompts.
:disclosure:Install to HQueue
    To copy the ZibraVDB Compression Library to HQROOT to make it available on HQueue nodes, click the __Copy Library to HQROOT__ button in the __Plugin Management__ window and follow on-screen prompts.

=== Acquire License Key ===

There are 5 free compressions before you need to purchase a license key to continue using the plugin.
# Purchase a license key on the [Zibra AI website|https://www.zibra.ai/zibravdb-pricing].
# Open Houdini and click the __Open Plugin Management__ button on any ZibraVDB node.
# Enter your license key string (not the file path) in the __License key__ field.
# Click the __Set License Key__ button. You should now see __Activation status__ as "Activated".

:disclosure:Activation using an environment variable
    # Create a text file in a directory of your choice and name it `zibravdb_license_key.txt`. Paste your license key into this text file and save it.
    # Set up a Houdini [environment variable|https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/basics/config_env.html#setting-environment-variables] named `ZIBRAVDB_LICENSE_KEY` and assign it the path to your license key file.

    TIP:
        For example, if you saved the license key file to `C:/Users/.../Documents/houdini20.5/zibra/`, then you may add the following line to your `houdini.env` file:

        `ZIBRAVDB_LICENSE_KEY = C:/Users/.../Documents/houdini20.5/zibra/zibravdb_license_key.txt`

        Please do not include the `#` at the beginning of a line. The `#` comments the line out.

        You may also use the [package mechanism|https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/ref/plugins.html] to set environment variables.


== About ZibraVDB == (aboutzibravdb)

[ZibraVDB|https://effects.zibra.ai/zibravdb-virtual-production] is a cutting-edge [VDB compression and real-time rendering technology|https://youtu.be/c8FQ_jidNH0?si=jKj1Rxj30FXA0err] developed by [Zibra AI|https://effects.zibra.ai/]. The compression can currently achieve up to 97–99% reduction in VDB file size with minimal quality loss. The proprietary `.zibravdb` file format captures an entire VDB sequence in a single file, which can be loaded into applications such as Houdini or Unreal Engine, decompressed on the GPU in real time, and played back in the viewport at speeds significantly faster than native solutions.

For artists, this provides a memory-efficient, high-performance volumetric data pipeline that seamlessly integrates into existing workflows.

It significantly reduces storage costs, improves volumetric data I/O speeds, and ultimately makes it easier and more practical to share working projects and distribute final products containing high-fidelity volumetric effects.

[ZibraVDB for Houdini|https://github.com/ZibraAI/ZibraVDBForHoudini], contributed by Zibra AI, is a SideFX Labs plugin that brings ZibraVDB’s compression, decompression, and accelerated playback capabilities into Houdini’s ecosystem.

Additionally, the compressed `.zibravdb` files can be used with [ZibraVDB for UE|https://www.fab.com/listings/23aef313-3c6a-40ea-810d-35de2ea5bca2]. This empowers artists to bring stunning volumetric effects created in Houdini to Unreal Engine and render them efficiently as full 3D ray-marched volumes in real time.

        Specifies whether to compress and render a single frame or a frame sequence of VDB geometry.
    
    Start/End/Inc:
        #id: f
        The start frame (inclusive), end frame (inclusive) and frame increment, when __Valid Frame Range__ is "Render Frame Range" or "Render Frame Range Only (Strict)".
