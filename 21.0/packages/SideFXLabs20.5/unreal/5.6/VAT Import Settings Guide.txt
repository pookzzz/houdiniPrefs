I. FBX Import Settings

Make sure the following settings are set to the these values (you can find the settings using the Search bar):

Offset Uniform Scale:           1.0
Import LODs:                    On
Vertex Color Import Option:     Replace
Recompute Normals:              Off
Recompute Tangents:             Off
Remove Degenerates:             Off
Import Static Meshes:           On
Fallback Collision Type:        None
Build Reversed Index Buffer:    Off
Build Scale:                    1.0  |  1.0  |  1.0




II. Texture Settings

1. In the Content Browser, select multiple textures.

2. Rght-click on any selected textures and go to Scripted Asset Actions.

3. Select either Houdini Config Textures for VAT (HDR) or Houdini Config Textures for VAT (SDR) to match 
Settings > All Modes > Texture Format on the VAT node in Houdini.

4. Hit Ctrl+S on selected textures to confirm the changes.

5. In Unreal, sometimes there are issues with power-of-two textures that have data in their alpha channels, 
in which case, consider using Houdini Config Textures for VAT (HDR) even if you exported those textures in 
SDR (non-HDR) formats in Houdini.




III. Static Mesh Settings

If there are tiny holes, tearing and flickering in your animation, particularly with the Dynamic Remeshing mode, 
consider open the mesh with the Mesh Editor, and then turn on LOD0 > Build Settings > UE4 Compatible UVs.

If there are still issues, consider turning on LOD0 > Build Settings > Use Full Precision UVs.




IV. Real-Time Data (JSON) File

VAT 3.0 normally does not require the Real-Time Data file, but you may still export it in certain situations:

A. You definitely have to use the legacy workflow in order to apply VAT materials to 
instanced meshes (ISM/HISM) or mesh particles.

B. You probably should use the legacy workflow if your animation spans a huge area.

Steps:

1. On the VAT node, go to Advanced, turn on Support Real-Time Instancing.
2. Render your assets.
3. In the UE Material Instance, turn on Support Legacy Parameters and Instancing.
4. Enable all six parameters now appearing below Support Legacy Parameters and Instancing.
5. Follow their tooltip to batch-set their values (all six bound parameters share the same tooltip).
