This experimental plugin is a variation of the standard SideFX Labs plugin for Unreal Engine.

It introduces a new C++ component to the plugin which contains precompiled binaries and their source code.

This new component adds artist-friendly Editor utilities and scripts that significantly simplify the process required to import and set up Vertex Animation Texture assets exported from Houdini.


We expect to set this experimental version to the standard version within the next 2 to 3 Houdini production build cycles. (Typically we release one production build per month.)
